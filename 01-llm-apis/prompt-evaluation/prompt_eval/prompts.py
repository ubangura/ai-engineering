GRADE_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE = """
Your task is to evaluate the following AI-generated solution with EXTREME RIGOR.

Original task description:
<task_description>
{task_description}
</task_description>

Original task inputs:
<task_inputs>
{{ {prompt_inputs} }}
</task_inputs>

Solution to Evaluate:
<solution>
{output}
</solution>

Criteria you should use to evaluate the solution:
<criteria>
{solution_criteria}
</criteria>

{extra_criteria_section}

Scoring Guidelines:
* Score 1-3: Solution fails to meet one or more MANDATORY requirements
* Score 4-6: Solution meets all mandatory requirements but has significant deficiencies in secondary criteria
* Score 7-8: Solution meets all mandatory requirements and most secondary criteria, with minor issues
* Score 9-10: Solution meets all mandatory and secondary criteria

IMPORTANT SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
* Grade the output based ONLY on the listed criteria. Do not add your own extra requirements.
* If a solution meets all of the mandatory and secondary criteria give it a 10
* Don't complain that the solution "only" meets the mandatory and secondary criteria. Solutions shouldn't go above and beyond - they should meet the exact listed criteria.
* ANY violation of a mandatory requirement MUST result in a score of 3 or lower
* The full 1-10 scale should be utilized - don't hesitate to give low scores when warranted

Output Format
Provide your evaluation as a structured JSON object with the following fields, in this specific order:
- "strengths": An array of 1-3 key strengths
- "weaknesses": An array of 1-3 key areas for improvement
- "reasoning": A concise explanation of your overall assessment
- "score": A number between 1-10

Respond with JSON. Keep your response concise and direct.
Example response shape:
{{
    "strengths": string[],
    "weaknesses": string[],
    "reasoning": string,
    "score": number
}}

GENERATE_IDEAS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a test scenario designer specialized in creating diverse, unique testing scenarios."

GENERATE_IDEAS_TEMPLATE = """
Generate {num_cases} unique, diverse ideas for testing a prompt that accomplishes this task:

<task_description>
{task_description}
</task_description>

The prompt will receive the following inputs
<prompt_inputs>
{prompt_inputs_spec}
</prompt_inputs>

Each idea should represent a distinct scenario or example that tests different aspects of the task.

Output Format:
Provide your response as a structured JSON array where each item is a brief description of the idea.

Example:
```json
[
    "Testing with technical computer science terminology",
    "Testing with medical research findings",
    "Testing with complex mathematical concepts",
    ...
]
```

Ensure each idea is:
- Clearly distinct from the others
- Relevant to the task description
- Specific enough to guide generation of a full test case
- Quick to solve without requiring extensive computation or multi-step processing
- Solvable with no more than 400 tokens of output

Remember, only generate {num_cases} unique ideas

Generate a single detailed test case for a prompt evaluation based on:

    "solution_criteria": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2", ...] // Concise list of criteria for evaluating the solution, 1 to 4 items
}}
```

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST ONLY use these exact input keys in your prompt_inputs: {allowed_keys}
- Do NOT add any additional keys to prompt_inputs
- All keys listed in allowed_input_keys must be included in your response
- Make the test case realistic and practically useful
- Include measurable, concise solution criteria
- The solution criteria should ONLY address the direct requirements of the task description and the generated prompt_inputs
- Avoid over-specifying criteria with requirements that go beyond the core task
- Keep solution criteria simple, focused, and directly tied to the fundamental task
- The test case should be tailored to the specific idea provided
- Quick to solve without requiring extensive computation or multi-step processing
- Solvable with no more than 400 tokens of output
- DO NOT include any fields beyond those specified in the output format

Here's an example of a sample input with an ideal output:
<sample_input>
<sample_task_description>
Extract topics out of a passage of text
</sample_task_description>
<sample_specific_idea>
Testing with a text that contains multiple nested topics and subtopics (e.g., a passage about renewable energy that covers solar power economics, wind turbine technology, and policy implications simultaneously)
</sample_specific_idea>

<sample_allowed_input_keys>
"content"
</sample_allowed_input_keys>
</sample_input>
<ideal_output>
```json
{
    "prompt_inputs": {
        "content": "The transition to renewable energy encompasses numerous interdependent dimensions. Solar photovoltaic technology has seen dramatic cost reductions, with panel efficiency improving 24% since 2010 while manufacturing costs declined by 89%, making it economically competitive with fossil fuels in many markets. Concurrently, wind energy has evolved through innovative turbine designs featuring carbon-fiber composite blades and advanced control systems that increase energy capture by 35% in low-wind conditions."
    },
    "solution_criteria": [
        "Includes all topics mentioned"
    ]
}
```
</ideal_output>
This is ideal output because the solution criteria is concise and doesn't ask for anything outside of the scope of the task description.
